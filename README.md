## My favorites!

* Day 8

* Day 10
* Day 14

## Where I struggled

### Day 11, part 2

### Day 13, part 1

Code works in the test set but not actual input. Took forever to find the bug in my code. Resorted to looking at other people's solutions before I managed to fix it.

### Day 15, part 2

~~(Not yet completed) Works in test. Running against input.txt takes too long. Need to re-evaluate the logic.~~
Update: Caching saved the day!

### Day 16, part 1

Needed a [hint](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zo21au/comment/j0nz8df/)
