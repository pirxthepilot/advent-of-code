# Advent of Code Solutions

My measly attempts at solving the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges


## 2023 Notes

### My favorites!

* Day 6 (wow, math)

### Where I struggled

#### Day 5, part 2

Still unsolved. Test is fine, but code is too inefficient to get the actual input solution.


## 2022 Notes

### My favorites!

* Day 8
* Day 9
* Day 10
* Day 14

### Where I struggled

#### Day 11, part 2

Neeeded a small hint to finally click

#### Day 13, part 1

Code works in the test set but not actual input. Took forever to find the bug in my code. Resorted to looking at other people's solutions before I managed to fix it.

#### Day 15, part 2

~~(Not yet completed) Works in test. Running against input.txt takes too long. Need to re-evaluate the logic.~~
Update: Caching saved the day!

#### Day 16, both parts

Needed a [hint](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zo21au/comment/j0nz8df/)

Also, not sure why my part 2 test result is off by two but correct against actual input??

#### Day 19, both parts

Needed hints (esp. [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zpy5rm/2022_day_19_what_are_your_insights_and/)) and mostly took forever to find the bug in my code :/
